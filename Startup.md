# Identity Wallet CLI Project Status and Next Steps
Here's a comprehensive overview of our progress and what's needed to achieve real testnet deployment:
What We've Accomplished
Wallet Integration Architecture
Created a robust wallet connection system with TypeScript implementations
Built browser-based connector for Midnight Lace Wallet interaction
Implemented proper type definitions for wallet interactions
Added credential storage for persistent wallet connections
CLI Architecture Updates
Modified middleware.ts to properly interact with Midnight network providers
Updated api.ts with proper contract structure handling
Enhanced config.ts with wallet-specific options
Fixed common-types.ts to reflect the new provider structure
Added wallet-connect command to CLI interface
Documentation
Created comprehensive README.md with clear instructions
Added user-friendly get-started.sh script
Next Steps for Testnet Deployment
Verify Wallet Connection Flow
Test the wallet-connect command to ensure it properly retrieves and stores wallet credentials
Verify that the browser connector page successfully communicates with the Midnight Lace Wallet
Ensure the coin public key is correctly retrieved from the wallet
Test Contract Deployment
Run yarn start deploy --wallet to deploy the contract to testnet
Verify that the middleware correctly forwards transactions to the wallet
Record the contract address when deployment is successful
Test Contract Interactions
Use the join command with a deployed contract address
Test verification functionality
Monitor transaction status through the wallet's transaction history
Troubleshooting Common Issues
If the wallet connection fails, check browser extensions and try again
If deployment fails with contract structure errors, verify the circuit definitions in api.ts
For transaction submission errors, check wallet account balances and network connectivity
Technical Requirements
Environment Requirements
Node.js v16+ and Yarn
Chrome browser with Midnight Lace Wallet v1.2.5+ installed
Testnet account with sufficient balance for deployment
Key Files to Review
src/wallet-connect.ts - Handles wallet connection logic
src/middleware.ts - Manages provider initialization
src/api.ts - Handles contract structure and deployment
src/cli.ts - Command line interface entry point
Build and Runtime Commands
yarn build - Build the TypeScript code
yarn wallet-connect - Connect to the Midnight Lace Wallet
yarn start deploy --wallet - Deploy contract using wallet
yarn start join <address> --wallet - Join existing contract
Outstanding Issues
TypeScript linter errors in middleware.ts (using type assertions to bypass)
Minor type compatibility issues between our interface and SDK requirements
Potential browser extension interaction quirks depending on Chrome version
This information should provide a solid foundation for continuing the project and achieving successful testnet deployment in the next session.
